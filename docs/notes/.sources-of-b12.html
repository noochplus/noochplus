<h1 id="the-soil">The Soil</h1>
<p>Here’s an unpleasant thought: just <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957">half a gram</a> of dried human fæces contains the daily requirement of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=107">vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a>. The bacteria that produce vitamin B<sub>12</sub> inhabit fæces in particular, and as a result, the <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-absorb-their-B12-by-the-bacteria-in-their-guts-or-do-they-need-to-eat-their-poop-afterwards-to-absorb-it/answer/Michael-McClennen">rabbit eats its own fæces</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Bacteria_and_archaea">second stomach of the cow eats the fæces of the first</a>, and humans, <a href="/notes/night-soil">traditionally grew their crops with ‘night soil’</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps for similar reasons, other sources include <a href="/notes/duckweed"><strong>duckweed</strong></a>; <strong>algæ</strong>, including <a href="/notes/chlorella">chlorella</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0101556">coccolithophores</a>; <strong>seaweed</strong>, including <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c">nori</a>, aka laver, and <a href="https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various">dulse</a>; along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=107#foodchart">animal products</a>.</p>
<h2 id="animal-products">Animal Products</h2>
<p>The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human history, culture, and <a href="/basics">health</a>. However, it is worth knowing the origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">the production techniques</a> tend to come as a surprise, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc">raise</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNED7GJLY7I">questions</a> of whether these products can be considered healthy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production">despite</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns">presence</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues">various</a> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/man_shall_not_live_by_bread_alone">nutrients</a>.</p>
<p>Even when avoiding meat from modern sources, there are still associated health risks, particularly regarding <a href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-research-says-even-moderate-red-and-processed-meat-eaters-at-risk-of-bowel-cancer/">red meat and the colon</a>.</p>
<p>Besides that, the land requirement is steep. For example, if everyone in <a href="/notes/british-land-available">Britain</a> obtained their B<sub>12</sub> from home-raised poultry, while otherwise following <a href="/basics">a basic diet</a>, then there would be land for around <a href="/notes/land-for-chicken"><em>45 million people</em></a>, with even less for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore">beef, lamb, pork, and cheese</a>. With a population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom"><em>65 million people</em></a>, meat would not be a viable source of B<sub>12</sub> for Britain as a whole, not when self-sufficiency is considered and <a href="https://landofhopeandglory.org/">factory-farms</a> are avoided.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Seaweed is a good source, but a lot is needed. Otherwise, algæ and duckweed are widely available, replicate rapidly, and have impressive nutritional profiles. However, they are rarely used in food. Instead, it may be useful to look at them as ways of making <a href="/notes/natural-b12-supplements">natural supplements</a>. For synthetic supplements, note that more than a few micrograms <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/b12-energy/537654/">may be harmful</a>.</p>
