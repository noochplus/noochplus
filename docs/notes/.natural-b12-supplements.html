<p>Both <a href="/notes/duckweed-b12">duckweed</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03550">chlorella</a> are potentially good sources of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, where two half-gram tablets can contain the daily requirement. In addition, both replicate rapidly, only requiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q">a small aquarium</a>.</p>
