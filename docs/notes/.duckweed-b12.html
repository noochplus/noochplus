<p>100g of fresh duckweed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210511050357/https://www.parabel.com/third-party-vitamin-b12-test-confirms-presence-in-parabels-water-lentil-crop/">has been found to contain 18μg of vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a>. In this case, the company was growing lemna minor and wolffia, seemingly <a href="https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsat.3404_15.x">in outdoor tanks</a> exposed to the air.</p>
<p>Public Health England <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/618167/government_dietary_recommendations.pdf">recommends <em>1.5μg</em> of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> per day</a>, or the amount that would then be in <em>8g</em> of fresh duckweed. Dried duckweed should be around <em>10%</em> the weight of fresh, and <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf">B<sub>12</sub> seems resilient to drying</a>.</p>
