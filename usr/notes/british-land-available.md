1. [The Extent of the Cultivable Land by Professor C. B. Fawcett](https://doi.org/10.2307/1783693)
	estimates that roughly half of the land is cultivable. For Britain,
	that means *26 million acres*.

2. [Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2020 by DEFRA](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056618/AUK2020_22feb22.pdf)
	states that the total UK cropland and grassland is *30 million acres*,
	along with *12.6 million acres* for grazing (see page 19, table 2.1).

	[Statistical Review of Northern Ireland Agriculture 2020 by DAERA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/daera/Stats%20Review%202020%20final_1.pdf)
	states that the total NI cropland and grassland is *2.1 million acres*,
	along with *0.3 million acres* for grazing (see page 38, table 3.2).

	Britain therefore has *28 million acres* of cropland and grassland,
	along with *12 million acres* for grazing.
