# Natural Supplements

Both [duckweed](/notes/duckweed-b12) and [chlorella](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03550)
are potentially good sources of vitamin B~12~, where two half-gram tablets
can contain the daily requirement. In addition, both replicate rapidly, only
requiring [a small aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q).

However, the amount can vary, and [may depend on a non-sterile growing environment](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/).
It's then also worth noting that they're [usually washed in hot water](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938),
before being dried.
