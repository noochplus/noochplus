# Seed Sensitivity

[Omega−3](https://web.archive.org/web/20210125052152id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=84#impactcookingstorageprocessing)
is a sensitive nutrient, susceptible to damage from light and air. Seeds that
are being used as a source of Omega−3 should ideally be kept whole until needed,
or otherwise kept in a dark, sealed container, preferably in a refrigerator,
and used within a month.

Omega−3 can also be damaged by heat, particularly the high heats of frying.
The heats involved in baking, however, [should be fine](http://web.archive.org/web/20110106054844/https://flaxcouncil.ca/english/pdf/stor.pdf).
