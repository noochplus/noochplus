# Duckweed; B~12~

100g of fresh duckweed [has been found to contain 18μg of vitamin B~12~](http://web.archive.org/web/20210511050357/https://www.parabel.com/third-party-vitamin-b12-test-confirms-presence-in-parabels-water-lentil-crop/).
In this case, the company was growing lemna minor and wolffia, seemingly
[in outdoor tanks](https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsat.3404_15.x)
exposed to the air.

Public Health England [recommends *1.5μg* of vitamin B~12~ per day](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/618167/government_dietary_recommendations.pdf),
or the amount that would then be in *8g* of fresh duckweed. Dried duckweed
should be around *10%* the weight of fresh, and [B~12~ seems resilient to
drying](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf).
