# Land for Chicken

Chickens eat [the same basic diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_feed)
as humans, i.e. [mostly grains and legumes](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325103301/http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6#Feed)
with sources of vitamins and minerals, while otherwise foraging for the rest.
High-tech nutritionally-complete chicken feeds are important for factory-farmed
chickens as they can't forage. Traditionally, however, chicken feed was more
supplementary, consisting of grain, scraps, and calcium.

Chickens tend to eat around [an eighth](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farming/nutrition-for-backyard-chicken-flocks/)
of [what a human eats](/basics), or around [*125g*](https://www.smallholderfeed.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Feeding-Hens-Factsheet.pdf)
of feed per day. As chicken feed [is basically grain](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325103301/http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6#Feed),
this would require around [*170m^2^*](/notes/land-for-cereals) to produce
organically, or one twenty-fourth of an acre.

With an average weight of [3kg](https://pethelpful.com/farm-pets/the-top-10-dual-purpose-chicken-breeds),
and an average meat yield of [65%](https://yourmeatguide.com/whole-chicken-portions-meat-yield/),
each bird will then produce around *2kg* of meat and [*44g*](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171060/measures)
of liver. Assuming a ‘harvest’ every [12 weeks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311553349_Are_carcass_and_meat_quality_of_male_dual-purpose_chickens_competitive_compared_to_slow-growing_broilers_reared_under_a_welfare-enhanced_organic_system),
each twenty-fourth will therefore produce around *8.6kg* of meat per year
and *190g* of liver.

As there is around [*6.9μg* of B~12~ in the meat](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107)
of a chicken and [*7.4μg* in the liver](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/much-vitamin-b12-chicken-livers-6063.html),
each chicken contains around *14.3μg* of B~12~, and so each twenty-fourth
will produce around *61.5μg* of B~12~ per year.

A yearly B~12~ requirement of [*550μg*](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/618167/government_dietary_recommendations.pdf)
would therefore translate to nine twenty-fourths of an acre, or 38 birds per
year. A quarter of an acre would still be needed for the rest of the human's
nutrition.

Chickens shouldn't be kept on the same land that is being used to grow
their feed, as they would trample on it and uproot it. They would therefore
need more land for pasture, where the traditional stocking density is around
[50 birds an acre](https://www.plamondon.com/wp/how-many-chickens-per-acre/),
or a fifth of an acre in this case. Each human would therefore need around
four-fifths of an acre in total.

Feeding the world in this way would require the annual slaughter of
around [*300 billion birds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Negative_effects_on_poultry_workers).
