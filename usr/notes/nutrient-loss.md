# Nutrient Loss

The main way of losing nutrients due to cooking is through boiling,
and then throwing away the water. The heat causes many nutrients to
leach into the water, at which point they will be lost if the water
is not used. Other methods [are usually not as damaging](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf),
although less heat for less time is better.

In general, foods should be stored away from heat, light, air, and
humidity, and used as soon as possible.
