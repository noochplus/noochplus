- The *daily requirement* is *125g*.

- The *chemical yield* is [*250g/m^2^*](https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/harvest/harvest-2016-growers-enjoy-soya-success-crop-yields-impress).
  Note that this is for Britain, which is not a good climate for soy.

- The *seeding rate* is [*120,000 seeds per acre*](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/soybean-seeding-rates).
  As each soybean weighs around [*0.15g*](https://www.feedipedia.org/node/42),
