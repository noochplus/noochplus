**Wholegrain flour,** *80g,* [recently ground](/notes/wholegrains),
for the minerals and fibre. Sources include barley, wheat, oats, and rye.

**White flour,** *320g,* for the energy and texture; the amount can be
increased and decreased as needed. It's healthier if more of the white
flour is replaced with wholegrain, increasing the water.

**Nuts,** *30g,* *recently ground*, for the vitamin E and B~7~.
Sources include almonds, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds.

**Seeds,** *15g,* [recently ground](/notes/seed-sensitivity), for the omega−3.
Sources include chia, hemp, flax, and walnuts. An alternative is a ml of
[algæ oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed_oil).

**Carrot,** *20g powder,* for the vitamin A. An alternative is sweet
potato powder.

**Acerola,** *1g powder,* for the vitamin C. Other sources include
15g of rosehip powder, 30g of blackcurrant powder, 60g of strawberry
powder, or around half a gram of ascorbic acid.

**Nutritional yeast,** *around 4g,* for the B vitamins, and the vitamin D
if it's been UV-treated. If it's not fortified with B~12~, either
[blend in a tablet](/notes/sources-of-b12), or try [nori](/basics).

**Kelp,** *powder,* *a pinch,* for the iodine.

**Chalk,** *1g,* aka calcium carbonate. An alternative is tofu set with gypsum,
aka calcium sulphate.

**Salt,** *around 10g,* for the sodium. Preferably a low-sodium salt for
the increased potassium; they are usually half sodium chloride and half
potassium chloride. For a self-raising flour, instead add around 10g of cream
of tartar, aka potassium bitartrate, half that of baking soda, and a few
grams of standard salt.

**Choline bitartrate,** *1g,* for the choline, i.e. the B~4~. This is
less relevant for those who have replaced all of the white flour with
wholegrains, or [whole foods in general](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126120914id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=50#foodsources).
Otherwise, it's worth mixing with half a gram of baking soda and water
to neutralise the acidic taste.

**Leaves,** *3g dried* or *12g fresh*, for the vitamin K. Here dried thyme
was used, but many dark green [leaves and herbs](/basics) are good candidates;
lighter green leaves have lower concentrations, such as lettuce, for which
*80 grams* is better. These, the nuts, seeds, [fruit](/basics), and some of
the wholegrains can also work well on the side, such as in a soup, sauce,
or smoothie. Depending on the method, this can lead to less [nutrient loss](/notes/nutrient-loss),
and more neutral results.

**Olive oil,** *around a tablespoon,* *optional*. Alternatives include
coconut, avocado, hazelnut, and [high-oleic sunflower oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kGnfXXIKZM).

**Water,** *around 300ml,* [varies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage#Dough_hydration)
depending on the method, ingredients, climate, etc. Add less at first, and more
if needed.

The result is a simple, [healthy](#nutrition), adaptable [baking](https://www.manjulaskitchen.com/roti-chapati-flat-indian-bread/)
flour. It's best paired with sources of [protein](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304164944id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=92),
such as [lentils, beans, peas, chickpeas, avocados, and tofu](/basics).
